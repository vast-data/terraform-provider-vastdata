## Schema

### Required

- `machine_account_name` (String) The name for the machine object representing the VAST Cluster to be created within the OU

### Optional

- `abac_read_only_value_name` (String) The attribute to use when querying a provider for a read only attribute access check
- `abac_read_write_value_name` (String) The attribute to use when querying a provider for a read-write attribute access check
- `binddn` (String) The bind DN for authenticating to the LDAP domain. You can specify any user account that has read access to the domain.
- `bindpw` (String) The password used with the Bind DN to authenticate to the LDAP server.
- `domain_name` (String) The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Active Directory domain to join.
- `domains_with_posix_attributes` (String) Allows to enumerate specific domains for POSIX attributes
in case posix_attributes_source is set to SPECIFIC_DOMAINS.
- `gid_number` (String) Override 'gidNumber' as the attribute of a group entry that contains the group's GID number. When binding VAST Cluster to AD, you may need to set this to 'gidnumber' (case sensitive).
- `group_login_name` (String) The attribute used to query Active Directory for the group login name in NFS ID mapping.
Applicable only with Active Directory and NFSv4.
- `group_searchbase` (String) Base DN for group queries within the joined domain only. When auto discovery is enabled, group queries outside the joined domain use auto-discovered Base DNs.
- `is_vms_auth_provider` (Boolean) Enables use of the LDAP for VMS authentication. Two LDAP configurations per cluster can be used for VMS authentication: one with Active Directory and one without.
- `ma_pwd_change_frequency` (String) Machine Account password change frequency.
- `ma_pwd_update_time` (String) Machine Account password update time.
- `mail_property_name` (String)
- `match_user` (String) The attribute to use when querying a provider for a user that matches a user that was already retrieved from another provider. A user entry that contains a matching value in this attribute will be considered the same user as the user previously retrieved.
- `method` (String) The authentication method configured on the LDAP server for authenticating clients.
- `monitor_action` (String) The type of periodic health check that VAST Cluster performs for the Active Directory provider. PING (default, less overhead and impact on the provider) = pings the provider. BIND = binds to the provider.
- `ntlm_enabled` (Boolean) Manages support of NTLM authentication method for SMB protocol.
- `organizational_unit` (String) A non default organizational unit (OU) in the Active Directory domain in which to create the machine object. If left empty, the machine object will be created in the default Computers OU.
- `port` (Number) The port of the remote LDAP server. Typical values: 389, 636.
- `posix_account` (String) Override 'posixAccount'as the object class that defines a user entry on the LDAP server. When binding VAST Cluster to AD, set this parameter to 'user' in order for authorization to work properly.
- `posix_attributes_source` (String) Defines which domains POSIX attributes will be supported from.
- `posix_group` (String) Override 'posixGroup' as the object class that defines a group entry on the LDAP server. When binding VAST Cluster to AD, set this parameter to 'group' in order for authorization to work properly.
- `query_groups_mode` (String) A mode setting for how groups are queried: Set to COMPATIBLE to look up user groups using the 'memberOf' and 'memberUid' attributes. Set to RFC2307BIS_ONLY to look up user groups using only the 'memberOf' attribute. Set to RFC2307_ONLY to look up user groups using only the 'memberUid' attribute. Set to NONE not to look up user groups other than by leading GID and primary group SID.
- `reverse_lookup` (Boolean) resolve netgroups into hostnames
- `scheduled_ma_pwd_change_enabled` (Boolean) Enables scheduled Machine Account password change.

- `smb_allowed` (Boolean) Indicates if the Active Directory configuration is allowed to serve as a provider for SMB attributes.
- `super_admin_groups` (Set of String) List of groups on the Active Directory provider. Members of these groups can log into VMS as cluster admin users.
- `tls_certificate` (String) TLS certificate to use for verifying the remote LDAP server's TLS certificate.
- `uid` (String) Override 'uid' as the attribute of a user entry on the LDAP server that contains the user name. When binding VAST Cluster to AD, you may need to set this to 'sAMAccountname'.
- `uid_member` (String) Override 'memberUid' as the attribute of a group entry on the LDAP server that contains names of group members. When binding VAST Cluster to AD, you may need to set this to 'memberUID'
- `uid_member_value_property_name` (String)
- `uid_number` (String) Override 'uidNumber' as the attribute of a user entry on the LDAP server that contains the UID number.
Often when binding VAST Cluster to Active Directory this does not need to be set.
- `url` (String) LDAP server URI in the format <scheme>://<address>. <address> can be either a DNS name or an IP address. Example: ldap://ldap.company.com
- `urls` (Set of String) Comma separated list of URIs of LDAP servers in the format <scheme>://<address>. The order of listing defines the priority order. The URI with highest priority that has a good health status is used.
- `use_auto_discovery` (Boolean) When enabled, Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs) and Active Directory domains are auto discovered. Queries extend beyond the joined domain to all domains in the forest. When disabled, queries are restricted to the joined domain and DCs must be provided in the URLs field.
- `use_ldaps` (Boolean) Use LDAPS for Auto-Discovery
- `use_multi_forest` (Boolean) Allow access for users from trusted domains on other forests.
- `use_posix` (Boolean) POSIX support
- `use_tls` (Boolean) Set to true to enable use of TLS to secure communication between VAST Cluster and the LDAP server.
- `user_login_name` (String) The attribute used to query Active Directory for the user login name in NFS ID mapping.
Applicable only with Active Directory and NFSv4.
- `username_property_name` (String) The attribute to use for querying users in VMS user-initated user queries. Default is 'name'. Sometimes set to 'cn'
