# vastdata_s3_policy_attachment (Resource)

One-to-one association between an S3 policy and a non-local group or user. This resource attaches a single S3 policy to either a group (identified by 'gid') or a user (identified by 'uid').

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "vastdata_s3_policy_attachment" "vastdb_policy_attachment1" {
  s3_policy_id = 1
  gid          = 1000
}

# Create another S3 policy attachment with ignore_present set to true.
# It will not fail if the user with uid=777 already has s3_policy_id=1 attached.
resource "vastdata_s3_policy_attachment" "vastdb_policy_attachment2" {
  s3_policy_id   = 1
  uid            = 777
  ignore_present = true
}

## Schema

### Required

- `s3_policy_id` (Number) The ID of the S3 policy to attach.

### Optional

- `context` (String) Specify the context for the user/group query.
- `gid` (Number) The GID of the non-local group to attach the policy to.
- `ignore_present` (Boolean) If set to true, the resource will not return an error if the specified S3 policy is already attached to the user or group. This is useful for gracefully handling pre-existing attachments.
- `tenant_id` (Number) The ID of the tenant to which the user or group belongs.
- `uid` (Number) The UID of the non-local user to attach the policy to.
