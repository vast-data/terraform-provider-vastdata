# vastdata_qos_policy (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource vastdata_qos_policy qos1 {
 name = "qos1"
 static_limits {
    max_writes_bw_mbps = 110
    max_reads_iops = 200
    max_writes_iops = 3001
 }
 capacity_limits {
        max_reads_bw_mbps_per_gb_capacity=100
        max_reads_iops_per_gb_capacity = 200
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String)

### Optional

- `capacity_limits` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--capacity_limits))
- `io_size_bytes` (Number) Sets the size of IO for static and capacity limit definitions. The number of IOs per request is obtained by dividing request size by IO size. Default: 64K, Recommended range: 4K - 1M
- `mode` (String) QoS provisioning mode Allowed Values are [STATIC USED_CAPACITY PROVISIONED_CAPACITY]
- `static_limits` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--static_limits))

### Read-Only

- `guid` (String) QoS Policy guid
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--capacity_limits"></a>
