## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The path to the volume relative to the subsystem directory. The path should not begin with a slash (/). You can include slashes inside the path to indicate a hierarchy of directories. The path will be created under the subsystem path for the volume. Any directory hierarchy indicated by slashes will be created accordingly. For example, if you specify b/c/d the directories <subsystem_path>/b and <subsystem_path>b/c will be created if they do not yet exist, as well as the new directory <subsystem_path>/b/c/d.
- `size` (Number) The volume size, in bytes.
- `view_id` (Number) The ID of the subsystem view on which to create the volume.

### Optional

- `tenant_id` (Number) Filter by tenant. Specify tenant ID.

### Read-Only

- `capacity` (Number) The amount of data written to the volume.
- `id` (Number) Volume ID
- `mapped_block_host_count` (Number) The number of block hosts mapped to the volume.
- `mapped_block_hosts_preview` (String) Mapped block hosts preview.
- `namespace_id` (Number) Available for mapped volumes, the namespace ID as used by hosts to search the volume within the subsystem. Each namespace ID is unique within the subsystem. If a volume snapshot is mapped to any host(s), a snapshot volume is created with its own namespace ID.
- `nguid` (String) The NGUID used by block hosts to access the volume.
- `tenant_name` (String) The name of the tenant to which the volume belongs.
- `uuid` (String) The UUID, used by hosts to search the volume in the subsystem.
