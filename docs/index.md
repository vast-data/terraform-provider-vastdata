# VAST Data Provider

## Example Usage

```terraform
#A Simple provider with warn version validation level
provider vastdata {
  username                = "<username>"
  port                    = 443
  password                = "<password>"
  host                    = "<address>"
  skip_ssl_verify         = true
  version_validation_mode = "warn"
}

#Define 2 providers for 2 different cluster with alias one with port 443 and one with port 9443

provider vastdata {
  api_token       = "<api_token>"
  port            = 443
  host            = "<address>"
  skip_ssl_verify = true
  alias           = clusterA
}

# Trigger Terraform to ask for password instead of hardcoding it
variable "password" {
  sensitive = true
}

provider vastdata {
  username        = "<username>"
  port            = 9443
  password        = var.password
  host            = "<address>"
  skip_ssl_verify = true
  alias           = clusterB
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `host` (String) The VastData Cluster hostname/address , if environment variable VASTDATA_HOST exists it will be used

### Optional

- `api_token` (String, Sensitive) The VastData Cluster API token. If environment variable VASTDATA_API_TOKEN exists it will be used
- `password` (String, Sensitive) The VastData Cluster password, if environment variable VASTDATA_CLUSTER_PASSWORD exists it will be used
- `port` (Number) The server API port (Default is 443) ,if environment variable VASTDATA_PORT exists it will be used
- `skip_ssl_verify` (Boolean) A boolean representing should SSL certificate be verified (Default is False) , if environmnet variable VASTDATA_VERIFY_SSL exists it will be used
- `username` (String, Sensitive) The VastData Cluster username, if environment variable VASTDATA_CLUSTER_USERNAME exists it will be used
- `version_validation_mode` (String) The version validation mode to use , version validation checks if a resource request will work with the current cluster version
			Depending on the value the operation will abort from happening if according to the version the operation might not work.
			2 options are valid for this attribute
			1. strict - abort the operation before it starts
			2. warn - Just issue a warning

## GUID fallback
For all the resources that have GUID as one of its attributes, there is a fallback request when the API responds with 404 Not Found.
If the VMS responds with new ID for given GUID, the provider will update the internal identifier of the resource.

This mechanism is enabled to prevent provider failure due to Leader backup restore.
