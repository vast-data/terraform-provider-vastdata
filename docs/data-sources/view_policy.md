data "vastdata_view_policy" "view_policy1" {
  name = "policy1"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) A uniqe name given to the view policy.

### Optional

- `use_auth_provider` (Boolean) Use configured Auth Provider(s) to enforce group permissions when set to true , if set to ture with out specifing auth_source , the auth_source set to "PROVIDERS". if set to false than auth_source set to RPC. Due to the nature or terrafrom simply changing use_auth_provider from false to true or the other way around will not change the value auth_source as terrafrom will keep hold on the previous value. therefor it is adviasable to always specify the value of auth_source
