# vastdata_qos_policy (Data Source)





<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String)

### Optional

- `capacity_limits` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--capacity_limits))
- `io_size_bytes` (Number) Sets the size of IO for static and capacity limit definitions. The number of IOs per request is obtained by dividing request size by IO size. Default: 64K, Recommended range: 4K - 1M
- `mode` (String) QoS provisioning mode Allowed Values are [STATIC USED_CAPACITY PROVISIONED_CAPACITY]
- `static_limits` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--static_limits))

### Read-Only

- `guid` (String) QoS Policy guid
- `id` (Number) The ID of this resource.
