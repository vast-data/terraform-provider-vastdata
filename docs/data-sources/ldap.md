- `abac_read_only_value_name` (String)
- `abac_read_write_value_name` (String)
- `active_directory` (String)
- `active_directory_id` (Number)
- `advanced_filter` (String) Manual filters for the BaseDN. This is useful when accounts are distributed across OUs and the baseDN needs to be wide to include all accounts, while there are also accounts that you would like to exclude from user queries.
- `binddn` (String) Distinguished name of LDAP superuser
- `bindpw` (String) Password for the LDAP superuser
- `domain_name` (String) FQDN of the domain.
- `gid_number` (String)
- `group_login_name` (String) The attribute used to query Active Directory for the group login name in NFS ID mapping. Applicable only with Active Directory and NFSv4.
- `group_searchbase` (String) Base DN for group queries within the joined domain only. When auto discovery is enabled, group queries outside the joined domain use auto-discovered Base DNs.
- `guid` (String)
- `is_vms_auth_provider` (Boolean) Enables use of the LDAP for VMS authentication. Two LDAP configurations per cluster can be used for VMS authentication: one with Active Directory and one without.
- `mail_property_name` (String) The attribute to use for the user's email address.
- `match_user` (String)
- `method` (String) Bind Authentication Method
- `monitor_action` (String) The type of periodic health check that VAST Cluster performs for the LDAP provider. PING (default, less overhead and impact on the provider) = pings the provider. BIND = binds to the provider.
- `name` (String)
- `port` (Number) LDAP server port. 389 (LDAP)  636 (LDAPS)
- `posix_account` (String)
- `posix_attributes_source` (String) Defines which domains POSIX attributes will be supported from.
- `posix_group` (String)
- `posix_primary_provider` (Boolean) POSIX primary provider
- `query_groups_mode` (String) Query group mode
- `reverse_lookup` (Boolean) Resolve LDAP netgroups into hostnames
- `searchbase` (String) The Base DN is the starting point the LDAP provider uses when searching for users and groups. If the Group Base DN is configured it will be used instead of the Base DN, for groups only
- `state` (String)
- `tenant_id` (Number) Tenant ID
- `title` (String)
- `tls_certificate` (String)
- `uid` (String)

Specify each URI in the format SCHEME://ADDRESS. ADDRESS can be either a DNS name or an IP address. e.g. ldap://ldap.company.com, ldaps://ldaps.company.com, ldap://192.0.2.2
- `use_auto_discovery` (Boolean) When enabled, Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs) and Active Directory domains are auto discovered. Queries extend beyond the joined domain to all domains in the forest. When disabled, queries are restricted to the joined domain and DCs must be provided in the URLs field.
- `use_ldaps` (Boolean) Use LDAPS for auto-Discovery. To activate, set use-auto-discovery to true also.
- `use_multi_forest` (Boolean) Allow access for users from trusted domains on other forests.
- `use_posix` (Boolean) POSIX support
