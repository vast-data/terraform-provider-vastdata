## Schema

### Required

- `machine_account_name` (String) Name of the computer object/machine account to add. Recommended to be the name of the cluster

### Optional

- `is_vms_auth_provider` (Boolean) Enables use of the AD for VMS authentication. Two AD configurations per cluster can be used for VMS authentication: one with AD and one without.
- `method` (String) Bind Authentication Method Allowed Values are [simple anonymous sasl]
- `ntlm_enabled` (Boolean) Manages support of NTLM authentication method for SMB protocol.
- `port` (Number) Which port to use
- `posix_attributes_source` (String) Defines which domains POSIX attributes will be supported from.
- `query_groups_mode` (String) Query group mode Allowed Values are [COMPATIBLE NONE RFC2307BIS RFC2307]
- `reverse_lookup` (Boolean) Resolve AD netgroups into hostnames
- `smb_allowed` (Boolean) Indicates if AD is allowed for SMB.
- `use_auto_discovery` (Boolean) When enabled, Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs) and Active Directory domains are auto discovered. Queries extend beyond the joined domain to all domains in the forest. When disabled, queries are restricted to the joined domain and DCs must be provided in the URLs field.
- `use_ldaps` (Boolean) Use LDAPS for auto-Discovery. To activate, set use_auto_discovery to true also.
- `use_multi_forest` (Boolean) Allow access for users from trusted domains on other forests.
- `use_tls` (Boolean) Set to true to enable use of TLS to secure communication between VAST Cluster and the AD server.

### Read-Only

- `binddn` (String) Distinguished name of AD superuser
- `bindpw` (String) The password used with the Bind DN to authenticate to the AD server.
- `domain_name` (String) FQDN of the domain.
- `gid_number` (String) The attribute of a user entry on the AD server that contains the UID number, if different from ‘uidNumber’. Often when binding VAST Cluster to AD this does not need to be set.
- `group_login_name` (String) Specifies the attribute used to query AD for the group login name in NFS ID mapping. Applicable only with AD and NFSv4.1.
- `guid` (String) A uniqe ID given to this resource
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `mail_property_name` (String) Specifies the attribute to use for the user’s email address.
- `match_user` (String) The attribute to use when querying a provider for a user that matches a user that was already retrieved from another provider. A user entry that contains a matching value in this attribute will be considered the same user as the user previously retrieved.
- `organizational_unit` (String) Organizational Unit within AD where the Cluster Machine account will be created. If left empty, it will go into default Computers OU
- `posix_account` (String) The object class that defines a user entry on the AD server, if different from ‘posixAccount’. When binding VAST Cluster to AD, set this parameter to ‘user’ in order for authorization to work properly.
- `posix_group` (String) The object class that defines a group entry on the AD server, if different from ‘posixGroup’. When binding VAST Cluster to AD, set this parameter to ‘group’ in order for authorization to work properly.
- `searchbase` (String) The Base DN is the starting point the AD provider uses when searching for users and groups. If the Group Base DN is configured it will be used instead of the Base DN, for groups only
- `tls_certificate` (String) TLS certificate to use for verifying the remote AD server’s TLS certificate.
- `uid` (String) The attribute of a user entry on the AD server that contains the user name, if different from ‘uid’ When binding VAST Cluster to AD, you may need to set this to ‘sAMAccountname’.
- `uid_member` (String) The attribute of a group entry on the AD server that contains names of group members, if different from ‘memberUid’. When binding VAST Cluster to AD, you may need to set this to ‘memberUID’.
- `uid_member_value_property_name` (String) Specifies the attribute which represents the value of the AD group’s member property.
- `uid_number` (String) The attribute of a user entry on the AD server that contains the UID number, if different from ‘uidNumber’. Often when binding VAST Cluster to AD this does not need to be set.
- `urls` (List of String) Comma separated list of URIs of AD servers in the format SCHEME://ADDRESS. The order of listing defines the priority order. The URI with highest priority that has a good health status is used.
- `user_login_name` (String) Specifies the attribute used to query AD for the user login name in NFS ID mapping. Applicable only with AD and NFSv4.1.
- `username_property_name` (String) The attribute to use for querying users in VMS user-initated user queries. Default is ‘name’. Sometimes set to ‘cn’
