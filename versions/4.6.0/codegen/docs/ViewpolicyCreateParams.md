**SmbFileMode** | **int32** | For multiprotocol views, if the security flavor is NFS, this parameter sets default unix permission bits for files created by SMB clients. Use three digit numeric notation, each digit representing the user, group and others compontents of the permissions, in that order. Each digit is the sum of the read bit, write bit and execute bit. If reading is permitted, the read bit adds 4 to the component. If writing is permitted, the write bit adds 2 to the component. If execution is permitted, the execute bit adds 1 to the component. | [optional] [default to null]
**SmbDirectoryMode** | **int32** | For multiprotocol views, if the security flavor is NFS, this parameter sets default unix permission bits for directories created by SMB clients. Use three digit numeric notation, each digit representing the user, group and others compontents of the permissions, in that order. Each digit is the sum of the read bit, write bit and execute bit. If reading is permitted, the read bit adds 4 to the component. If writing is permitted, the write bit adds 2 to the component. If execution is permitted, the execute bit adds 1 to the component. | [optional] [default to null]
